After completing this course, you will be able to create a full stack application, develop static and dynamic pages for a website. Develop containerized backend services using Express and MongoDB, deploy microservices on code engine and use them. Work with Django back-end and REACT front-end. This course is intended for anyone enrolled in the Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate program and who has completed all the previous courses in the PC. You should be familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, GitHub, Node.js Express, Python, Flask, Django Containers, microservices and serverless. The Capstone project course is a six week course with six modules. In this capstone you will create a car dealership's review portal.

In this Capstone project, you now have the opportunity to demonstrate the skills you have acquired throughout the program:
- Start by forking the GitHub repository through the link provided and cloning the Django application starter code to build your application.
- Create a few static web pages using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
- Add user management which includes user registration, login and logout along with session management to the Django application with the react front end. 
- Create back-end services in JavaScript that connect with MongoDB. 
- Containerize MongoDB and express server to provide the API endpoints, accessing data about the dealership and their reviews. 
- Deploy a sentiment analyzer microservice written with Python, flask and natural language toolkit or NLTK using the IBM cloud code engine. 
- Adding dynamic react pages to get dealership details, get reviews of the dealership for all end users and add reviews to the dealership for registered users. 
- Create user friendly and aesthetic fronted pages to present these services to the end users. 
- Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery or CI/CD with GitHub workflow for linting.
- Ensure that your Exprsmongo server is running on Docker and that the sentiment analyzer microservice is accessible. 
- Provide your application with the ability to run in a container. You will also add deployment artifacts to the application so it can be managed by Kubernetes.
